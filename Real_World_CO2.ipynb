    "For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. In this project you should:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    " - Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    " - Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    " - Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
